# Generic Platform
-The goal is to create a generic platform to train planty IAs on environements.

## Organisation
-First you will found one folder "environments" and 2 files "start.py and utils_platfrom.py

### Lauchn
- Start.py is usefull to train, test your IA in a simple way.
- utils_platfrom.py is the file where you can found all the train, test fonction but less simple.
### Environments
- You will found 2 folder, one is the folder "UUV_Mono_Agent", it's an exemple of environment.

- Ia_model  is just where u fill save your model.
- env is where the principal fonction are.
- utils is where your sp√©cific fonction are.
- views2d provide a 2d visualisation of your env (usefull during testing).
- bridge allow you to swith between a simple vehicule (UUV,USV,UAV) to a real vehicle.
- Inside implementations.py you will found 2class SimpleImplementation and RealImplementation. Simple is for the trainning, it's where to fake a real vehicule during the trainning part. Real is for the testing part, but you can also test with simple implementation
